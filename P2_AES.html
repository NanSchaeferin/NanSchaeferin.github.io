  <h1>Cryptography(II)&emsp;Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</h1>
  <h3>Nan Jiang &emsp; 20/06/2018</h3>

  <h2>Introduction to AES</h2>
  <p>The <i>Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)</i>, which was proposed by Belgian scientists Joan Daemen and Vincent
    Rijmen, is the most popular among all the symmetric ciphers. It is widely used in many systems such as the
    Internet security standard IPsec, TLS, the Wi-Fi encryption standard IEEE 802.11i, the secure shell network
    protocol SSH(Secure Shell), the Internet phone Skype. The two Belgian researchers named their system <i>Rijndael</i>
    and it is designed based off of Galois Field. The block cipher can handle a block with 128 bit size and contains
    three keys of different lengths 128, 192 and 256 bit. One more advantage over DES, AES proves to be efficient in both
    hardware and software. Other than brute-force, no methods by now are able to break AES.</p>

  <h2>One Glance at Galois Field</h2>
  <p>A <i>Field</i> is a set of elements that can form an additive group and a multiplicative group with distributivity.
    The number of the elements inside is called the cardinality or order of the field. If the order is limited, then the
    field is <i>Finite Field</i> or <i>Galios Field</i> that is interesting to us. In AES, a <i>Galios Field</i> of 256
    elements <i>GF</i>(256)is used. The element in <i>Galios Field</i> of <i>GF</i>(\(2^8\)) is a polynomial of the order 8
    like $$A(x)=a_7x^7+...+a_1x+a_0,\quad a_i \in GF(2)={0,1}.$$ The addition operation defined in <i>Galios Field</i> is
    simply polynomial addition. We add the coefficients of corresponding terms and then modulo 2. The multiplication rule
    is based on the multiplication of polynomials as well. We simpy multiplies two polynomials and modulo some polynomial
    called "irreducible polynomial" in order to make the result again into the field. In detail, for two elements \(A(x)\)
    and \(B(x)\) in <i>GF</i>(\(2^8\)), then $$Addition: \quad C(x)=A(x)+B(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{7}c_ix^i, \quad c_i\equiv a_i+b_i
    \, mod\, 2$$ $$Multiplication: \quad C(x)=A(x)\cdot B(x)\, mod \, P(x)$$ The irreducible polynomial here chosen is \(P(x)
    = x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1\). With help of this irreducible polynomial we can generate a inversion table of all the elements in
    <i>GF</i>\((2^8)\) as Fig.1, where the row and column are the hexadecimal notation of the coefficients.

  <h2>The Internal Structure of AES</h2>
  <p>The input of AES is 128 bits or 16 bytes. Fig.2 shows in each round in AES, each of 16 bytes will go through ByteSubstitution
    layer, ShiftRows layer and MixColumn layer in order. Unlike DES that uses 8 different S-Box to ensure confusion, AES adopts 16
    identical S-box to do nonlinear function. The S-Box is from the table in Fig.1. The diffusion layer contains two sublayers
    spreading the influence of one single bit over the entire state. Here, ShiftRows and MixColumn transformations perform a
    linear operation. ShiftRows simply shifts each bytes in the second, third, fourth positions of every subblocks to the position
    identical shifts.

  </figure>
  <p>The operation MixColumn of AES is the multiplication defined in <i>Galios Field</i>. The corresponding multiplication can be
    seen from Fig.3 and it promises one byte changing anywhere will change all the 16 bytes output. After ByteSubstitution,
    ShiftRows and MixColumn, the results will be bitwise XOR with the key. The keys in case of 128 bits requires 10 rounds to
    produce all the subkeys used in AES. The key schedule consists mainly XOR operation, rotation, ByteSubstitution and variable
    round coefficents from <i>Galios Field</i>.

  <h2>Decryption of AES</h2>
  <p> Since AES is not composed of Feistel Structure, the structure of decryption model should be exactly inversion of encryption.
    From the ByteSubstitution, ShiftRows and MixColumn these three different sublayers, the inversion is rather naive. We only have
    to compute the inversion of matrix in MixColumn and shift the result reversely. Concerning ByteSubstitution, it is a just
    step to look up S-Box table again.
