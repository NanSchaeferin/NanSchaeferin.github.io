    <h2>Introduction to Cryptography</h2>
    <p>The history of cryptology dates back to 4000 years ago when ancient Egyptian firstly used letter-based
      encryption.And the word of cryptology is combined with two seperate words, crypto and logy, which mean "hidden,
      secret" and "a subject of study" in ancient Greek. Cryptology splits into two main branches: cryptography and
      cryptoanalysis that are the science of hiding information and breaking cryptosystems respectively. In detail,
      cryptography itself splits into three main branches: symmetric ciphers which use symmetric structures and a key
      for encryption and decryption method;asymmetric (or Public-Key) ciphers which use a pair of keys namely a public
      key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data; protocols that define the usage of cryptographic algorithms.
      The classification of the field of cryptology can be seen as follows:</p>

    <h2>Symmetric Cryptography</h2>
    <p>It is a everyday situation when two people want to communicate with each other using an insecure channel. Let's
      say Alice wants to send a secret message to her friend Bob via a medium, e.g. Internet. However, a bad guy Oscar
      in the Internet has access to this message and enjoys reading it. It is therefore of necessity for Alice to encrypt
      her message so that Oscar is not able to know the meaning in spite of hacking it. To the other end, Bob must know
      the decryption method of this encrypted message to read it. The procedure is like:</p>

      <figcaption>Fig.2 - Alice-Oscar-Bob Crytosystem.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In Fig.1 we can see Alice and Bob substitute the previous insecure channel with cryptosystem. The cryptosystem
      is called symmetric-key when Alice and Bob share a single key. As a rule of thumb, the encryption function
      <i>e()</i> and decryption function <i>d()</i> have an identical structure. The variables <i>x, y</i> and
      <i>k</i> are significant and have termiologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>x is called plaintext or cleartext referring to the raw message,</li>
      <li>k is called the key encrypting and decrypting data,</li>
      <li>y is called ciphertext referring to the encrypted message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
    <p>One of the most comnon symmetric ciphers is substitution cipher, of which Caesar cipher or shift cipher is a
      special case. Caesar just shifted each </p>
