    <h2>Introduction to Cryptography</h2>
    <p>The history of cryptology dates back to 4000 years ago when ancient Egyptian firstly used letter-based
      encryption.And the word of cryptology is combined with two seperate words, crypto and logy, which mean "hidden,
      secret" and "a subject of study" in ancient Greek. Cryptology splits into two main branches: cryptography and
      cryptoanalysis that are the science of hiding information and breaking cryptosystems respectively. In detail,
      cryptography itself splits into three main branches: symmetric ciphers which use symmetric structures and a key
      for encryption and decryption method;asymmetric (or Public-Key) ciphers which use a pair of keys namely a public
      key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data; protocols that define the usage of cryptographic algorithms.
      The classification of the field of cryptology can be seen as follows:</p>

    <h2>Symmetric Cryptography</h2>
    <p>It is a everyday situation when two people want to communicate with each other using an insecure channel. Let's
      say Alice wants to send a secret message to her friend Bob via a medium, e.g. Internet. However, a bad guy Oscar
      in the Internet has access to this message and enjoys reading it. It is therefore of necessity for Alice to encrypt
      her message so that Oscar is not able to know the meaning in spite of hacking it. To the other end, Bob must know
      the decryption method of this encrypted message to read it. The procedure is like:</p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>Fig.2 - Alice-Oscar-Bob Crytosystem.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In Fig.1 we can see Alice and Bob substitute the previous insecure channel with cryptosystem. The cryptosystem
      is called symmetric-key when Alice and Bob share a single key. As a rule of thumb, the encryption function
      <i>e()</i> and decryption function <i>d()</i> have an identical structure. The variables <i>x, y</i> and
      <i>k</i> are significant and have termiologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>x is called plaintext or cleartext referring to the raw message,</li>
      <li>k is called the key encrypting and decrypting data,</li>
      <li>y is called ciphertext referring to the encrypted message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
    <p>One of the most comnon symmetric ciphers is substitution cipher, which substitutes each letter with different
      one. One of the most well-known is  Caesar cipher or shift cipher. Caesar just shifted each letter in plaintexts
      by a specific positions to generate the ciphertext. For example, Caesar's most famous phrase "Veni, vidi, vici"
      will be encrypted to "Yhql, ylgl, ylfl" with a right of 3. If we enumberate the alphabets, then this encryption
      function of one letter x with the right shift k as the key can be described mathematically like, </p>
    <center>y &equiv; x + k <i>mod</i> 26</center>
    <p>The corresponding decryption function sharing the same parameter, i.e. the key k is,</p>
    <center>x &equiv; y - k <i>mod</i> 26</center>
    <p>However, Caesar cipher is not really secure. People such as Oscar can crack it by means of either brute-force
      search or letter frequency analysis. Unlike ordinary substitution cipher of tremendous key space, Caesar cipher
      only adopts a small key space namely 26. It is very easy to exhaustively traverse the key space. Even if it had
      huge key space, Oscar still should be prone to attack it. Because in writings, some letters appear much more
      frequently that the others. Oscar can analyse the frequency of letters in the ciphertext to guess the key. </p>

    <h2>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</h2>
    <p>Data encryption standard (DES) encrypting blocks of 64 bits using a key of 56 bits was released by IBM and
      National Security Agency(NSA) in 1970s. DES combines two primitive operation proposed by the famous information
      theoriest Claude Shannon to ensure a strong encryption: Confusion that hides the relationship between key and
      ciphertext; Diffusion that addresses the issue of frequency analysis to map one plaintext symbol to many
      ciphertext symbols.</p>
    <p>DES derives from feistel cipher which has a structure like in Fig.3. Plaintext firstly goes through an initial
      permutation permutating bitwise, then it splits into two halves of which each has 32 bits. These two halves will
      be dealed in Feistel network for 16 rounds.</p>
    <center><i>L<sub>i</sub> = R<sub>i-1</sub></i>,</center>
    <center><i>R<sub>i</sub> = L<sub>i-1</sub></i> &oplus; <i>f(R<sub>i-1</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>)</i></center>
    <p>As the formula above shows, in each round, the right half is kept while the left half is encrypted by <i>f-</i>
      function with the key and the right half as parameters. Afterwards, the outcome is swapped and fed into next
      round. Finally, the result will be permutated reversely.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="Feistel_Structure.png" alt="The Feistel structure of DES" class="center">
      <figcaption>Fig.3-The inner structure of DES</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It is necessary to mention here, from Fig-3 it seems DES has a key of 64 bits but in fact every 8-th bit is used
      as the parity bit. Therefore the key lenght of DES is still 56 bits. After bitwise permutation, the 56 bits' key
      is cyclically left shifted either by 1 bit or 2 bits round by round.  Then let's look into the detail of <i>f-</i>
      function which is crucial due to taking both confusion and diffusion. As Fig-4 depicts, the right half of 32 bits
      is expanded in the expansion E-box to 8 blocks of 4 bits. In this procedure, 4 bits in the same block are assigned
      to 6 bits and the E-box adds diffusion to DES. The 8 blocks' results of XOR between the expanded right half and
      the key return to S-box that is nothing else than a mapping table. Each mapping table has a size of 4*16 and uses
      the first and the last bits of input as the row index and the rest 4 as column index to fetch output. The
      complicated nonlinear S-box adds confusion to DES.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The one advantage of DES is encryption shares the same function and key with decryption. Because the encryption
      and decryption functions of XOR are identical, decryption of DES is just reversely to do the same rounds
      computation from the end tothe top of encryption procedure.</p>
    <p>From 1970s to 1990s, DES has been proven secure and promoted widely. Unfortunately, the development of hardware
      with just brute-force search made DES of small key space not reliable anymore.</p>
