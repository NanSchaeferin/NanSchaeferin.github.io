    <h2>Introduction to cryptography</h2>
    <p>The history of cryptology can be dated back to 4000 years ago when ancient Egyptian firstly used letter-based encryption. And the word of cryptology is combined with two seperate words, crypto and logy, which mean "hidden, secret" and "a subject of study" in ancient Greek. Cryptology splits into two main branches: cryptography and cryptoanalysis that are the science of hiding information and breaking cryptosystems respectively. In detail, cryptography itself splits into three main branches: symmetric ciphers which use symmetric structures and a key for encryption and decryption method;asymmetric (or Public-Key) ciphers which use a pair of keys namely a public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data; </p>
